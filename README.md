# Physics-Informed Neural Network Tutorial

## Overview

This tutorial introduces the concept of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and demonstrates how integrating the physics of a system into a neural network can enhance its performance. By the end of this tutorial, you will understand the basics of PINNs and be able to implement them for solving physics-based problems.


## Introduction

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) combine the power of neural networks with the underlying physics equations governing a system. By incorporating known physical laws into the training process, PINNs can provide accurate predictions even with limited data.
